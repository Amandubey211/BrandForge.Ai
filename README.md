## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Integrates with Google Gemini to generate compelling headlines, body text, and hashtags based on a core message and selected brand tone.
*   **Dynamic Brand Alignment:** Users can select a primary brand color that instantly updates the entire UI and is passed to the AI for context-aware content generation.
*   **Interactive WYSIWYG Editor:** A robust "What You See Is What You Get" post preview. The live editor is a perfectly scaled version of the final output, ensuring complete visual consistency.
*   **Draggable Logo with Boundary Detection:** Users can upload and freely drag their logo across the canvas. The drag logic is constrained within the post's boundaries to prevent the logo from ever being lost.
*   **Multiple Layout Templates:** Choose between different social media post layouts (e.g., Standard, Footer Focus) to best suit the content.
*   **High-Resolution Image Downloads:** Generates and downloads a pixel-perfect, 1080x1350px PNG of the final post, ready for social media.
*   **Polished & Animated UI:** The entire application is built with a focus on user experience, featuring fluid animations (`Framer Motion`), a glassmorphic header, delightful user feedback (`react-confetti`, `sonner`), and premium smooth scrolling (`Lenis`).

## üèõÔ∏è Final Architecture: The "Scaled WYSIWYG" Model

After encountering challenges with layout consistency between the live preview and the final download, the project was re-architected to a more robust and elegant solution.

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** A single master component, **`SocialPostCard.tsx`**, defines the pixel-perfect, high-resolution (1080x1350px) layout of the final social media post. This component is the definitive source of truth for the post's appearance.

2.  **Perfect WYSIWYG via Scaling:** The interactive live preview renders this high-resolution `SocialPostCard` and uses **CSS `transform: scale()`** to shrink it down to fit the editor's viewport. This guarantees that the text wrapping, spacing, and element positioning in the preview are identical to the final output.

3.  **Percentage-Based Positioning:** The draggable logo's position is stored as percentage values (`{ x: 0-100, y: 0-100 }`). This allows the position to be applied universally, whether on the scaled-down live preview or the full-resolution download canvas.

4.  **Reliable Downloads:** The download function targets a hidden, full-size instance of `SocialPostCard`, ensuring the output is always a high-quality, complete image with no cut-off content.

This architecture eliminates state synchronization issues and layout inconsistencies, resulting in a stable, predictable, and powerful user experience.
