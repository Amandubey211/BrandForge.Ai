## ‚ú® Key Features

This project focuses on creating a polished, intuitive, and delightful user experience as the foundation for the core AI functionality.

*   **Glassmorphic Dynamic Header:** A modern, sticky header that elegantly transforms from a transparent overlay to a floating glass panel on scroll.
*   **Engaging Animations & Transitions:** The entire UI is brought to life with sophisticated animations using **GSAP** for text reveals and **Framer Motion** for interactive elements and background visuals.
*   **Premium Smooth Scrolling:** Utilizes **Lenis** to ensure a fluid and seamless navigation experience across the entire application, mimicking the feel of a native application.
*   **Interactive Branding:** Users can immediately experience the tool's core promise by live-editing the brand color directly in the hero section, with all relevant UI elements updating in real-time.
*   **Robust & Scalable Architecture:** Built with a clean, component-based structure that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions & Philosophy

The development process prioritized establishing a high-quality, interactive user experience *before* integrating the core backend logic. This "UX-First" approach ensures the final product is not just functional, but genuinely enjoyable to use.

*   **Component-Driven Architecture:** The UI is broken down into logical, reusable components (`Header`, `HeroSection`, `SplitText`). This promotes maintainability, scalability, and clean code.
*   **Centralized State Management:** Page-level state is managed in the main `page.tsx` component and passed down as props. This follows the "lifting state up" pattern, creating a single source of truth for the application's data.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Global logic, such as the initialization of the Lenis smooth scroller, is handled in a dedicated client wrapper within the `RootLayout`. This separates global concerns from page-specific logic, making the codebase more predictable and organized.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

The project is being developed in two distinct phases:

-   [x] **Phase 1: UI/UX Foundation (Complete)**
    -   [x] Design and build the core layout and components.
    -   [x] Implement all animations, transitions, and interactive elements.
    -   [x] Establish a robust and scalable front-end architecture.

-   [ ] **Phase 2: Core AI Functionality (In Progress)**
    -   [ ] Implement file upload logic for vendor images and logos.
    -   [ ] Create the Next.js API route for Google Gemini integration.
    -   [ ] Engineer the prompt to incorporate brand identity (color, tone).
    -   [ ] Develop the logic to combine the vendor's image with the AI-generated text into a final, polished visual.
